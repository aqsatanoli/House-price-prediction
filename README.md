# House-Price-Prediction
In this project, we used four regression algorithms to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location. Linear Regression provides a simple baseline by assuming a linear relationship, while Decision Tree Regression captures non-linear patterns through feature-based splits. Random Forest Regression enhances accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting, and Gradient Boosting Regressor builds models sequentially to correct errors and achieve high performance. These models were compared to identify the most effective approach for accurate price prediction
